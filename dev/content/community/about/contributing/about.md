The Upsun Developer Center is written using the Static Site Generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
Hugo, written in Go, compiles Markdown files alongside templated files, Javascript, and stylesheets to produce static HTML.

You can find all content within this site in the `content` subdirectory.

The Developer Center looks the way that it does through the use of Hugo [themes](https://gohugo.io/contribute/themes/).
In this case, much of this site's appearance comes from building on top of the [Hextra Hugo Theme](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/), 
published under an [MIT License](https://github.com/imfing/hextra/blob/main/LICENSE).

The final project is built, deployed, and hosted on Upsun.
