High-performing teams sustain their momentum through the synergy of skilled individuals, efficient processes, and adaptable practices. The primary objective of performance tuning is to minimize inefficiencies and bolster a team's ability to withstand external disruptions.

Delve into a diverse array of techniques and processes aimed at reducing wastage and enhancing resilience with Branislav Bujisic. Our journey will commence with an exploration of the contemporary skill set essential for constructing swift and anti-fragile systems. Subsequently, we will delve into the development and management methodologies that underpin both the team and product in the face of a dynamic environment. Finally, we will investigate the tools available to support these methodologies effectively.

This session will provide valuable insights to anyone with an interest in DevOps, team scaling, and agile methodologies.
