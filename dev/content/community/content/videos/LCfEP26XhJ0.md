On 3 April Platform.sh sponsored the well loved [AWS Summit Paris 2024](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/events/summits/emea/paris/) 
to launch its brand new PaaS offering — [Upsun](https://www.upsun.com). 
AWS Summit is the largest event dedicated to cloud, data, and AI.

We joined AWS experts, leaders, partners, and customers for a variety of demonstrations, workshops, labs, 
and more—including a couple of sessions hosted by our team.
