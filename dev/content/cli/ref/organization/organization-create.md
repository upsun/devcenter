organization:create
-------------------
Create a new organization

## Usage:

```
upsun organization:create [--label LABEL] [--name NAME] [--country COUNTRY]
```

Organizations allow you to manage your Upsun projects, users and billing. Projects are owned by organizations.

You can add other users to your organization, for collaboratively managing the organization as well as its projects and billing information.

Access to individual projects (API and SSH) is managed separately, for now.
