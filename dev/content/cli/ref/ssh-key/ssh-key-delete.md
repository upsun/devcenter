ssh-key:delete
--------------
Delete an SSH key

## Usage:

```
upsun ssh-key:delete [<id>]
```

This command lets you delete SSH keys from your account.

SSH keys are no longer needed by default, as SSH certificates are supported.
Certificates offer more security than keys.

To load or check your SSH certificate, run: upsun ssh-cert:load
