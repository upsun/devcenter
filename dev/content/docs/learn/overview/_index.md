{{% vendor/name %}} is a Platform-as-a-Service built especially for continuous deployment.
It allows you to host web applications on the cloud while making your development and testing workflows more productive.

If you're new to {{% vendor/name %}}, the [Philosophy](/docs/learn/overview/philosophy.md), [Structure](/docs/learn/overview/structure.md),
and [Build and Deploy](/docs/learn/overview/build-deploy.md) pages cover all the basics to start on the right track.

The main requirement of {{% vendor/name %}} is that you use Git to manage your application code.
If you have a single-app project, you can configure it from a single `{{< vendor/configfile "app" >}}` file,
usually located at the root of your app folder in your Git repository.
[Multi-app projects](/docs/create-apps/multi-app/_index.md) can be set up in various ways.

{{% vendor/name %}} is built on Debian, supports many different programming [languages](/docs/languages.md) and environments,
and features recommended optimizations for several [featured frameworks](/docs/get-started/here/_index.md).

Finally, you can also get tips for setting up your own [development workflow](/docs/development/_index.md)
and [administrating](/docs/administration/_index.md) your {{% vendor/name %}} account.
