Rails 8.0 Release Candidate just dropped, and it's packed with exciting features focused on deployment simplicity. While Rails 8 introduces tools like Kamal for "PaaS-free" deployment, there's still immense value in using a modern cloud platform like Upsun - especially when you want to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

Let's build a simple blog application and deploy it to production **in under 10 minutes**!

![Final Blog Application](/images/rails8-upsun-tutorial/rails8-blog-index.png "0.5")

## Prerequisites

- Basic Ruby knowledge
- macOS (though Windows/Linux instructions available)
- [Upsun CLI](https://docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.html) installed
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) 3.3+ installed

## Part 1: Local Development

{{% steps %}}

### Setting Up Your Environment

First, let's install Ruby and Rails on your Mac:

```bash
# Install Ruby 3.3 via brew
brew install ruby

# Install Rails 8 RC
gem install rails -v8.0.0.rc1

# Ensure bundler is up to date especially if you just upgraded Ruby
gem uninstall bundler --all --force && gem install bundler
```

If you want to use PostgreSQL locally via the `pg` gem, you need to install `postgresql@15` on your machine to compile the extension:

```shell
brew install postgresql@15
gem install pg
```

If you only want to use `sqlite` locally and `pg` on your production install, you will need to add `bundle config set frozen false` to the Upsun build phase so that `bundle` can still install the gem on Upsun.

### Bootstraping your Rails 8 blog

Let's create a new Rails application:

```bash
rails new rails-blog
cd rails-blog
```

{{< callout emoji="ðŸ’¡" type="blue">}}
**Pro tip:** Rails 8 uses SQLite by default, which works great for local development but also with Upsun's persistent storage!
{{< /callout >}}

### Building the Blog Features

We'll follow the standard Rails blog tutorial but with some modern twists. Here are the key models we'll create:

```bash
# Generate the Article model
bin/rails generate model Article title:string body:text
bin/rails generate model Comment commenter:string body:text article:references

# Run migrations
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Add the following to `app/models/article.rb` to map the relationship between `Articles` and `Comments`:

```ruby {filename="app/models/article.rb"}
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  
  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :body, presence: true, length: { minimum: 10 }
end
```

Head over to `routes.rb` and define the following:

```ruby {filename="routes.rb"}
root "articles#index"
resources :articles do
  resources :comments
end
```

We are using a `resources` here to make thing simple but we could also specify only the `index` and `show` routes.

And add the reverse one:

```ruby {filename="app/models/comment.rb"}
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :article
end
```

### To the controllers

Let's create the two controllers we need there to handle our `Articles` and `Comments`.

The `articles_controller.rb` just specifies two actions, `index` and `show`:

```ruby {filename="app/controllers/articles_controller.rb"}
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

The `comments_controller.rb` only handles the `Comment` creation process as the display is handled by the `ArticlesController` directly:

```ruby {filename="app/controllers/comments_controller.rb"}
class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
    @comment = @article.comments.create(comment_params)
    redirect_to article_path(@article)
  end

  private
    def comment_params
      params.require(:comment).permit(:commenter, :body)
    end
end
```

### Let's create the Views

With the magic of [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai), we can generate some boilerplate TailwindCSS templates for our pages. If you are curious, here is the prompt that was used. Don't forget to upload your `.erb` template in the UI first.

{{% callout %}}
**Prompt:** Refactor the following Ruby on Rails template. Using TailwindCSS, create a simple and modern design to list the articles from the blog. Include the main blog name. Each article will be show with its title, publication date and a read more button.
{{% /callout %}}

Let's start with our index page `app/views/articles/index.html.erb`:

```html {filename="app/views/articles/index.html.erb"}
<div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-8">Rails 8 on Upsun</h1>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-6">Articles</h2>

  <div class="space-y-6">
    <% @articles.each do |article| %>
      <div class="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition duration-300">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">
          <%= link_to article.title, article_path(article), class: "hover:underline" %>
        </h3>
        <% if article.created_at %>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
            Published on: <%= article.created_at.strftime("%B %d, %Y") %>
          </p>
        <% end %>
        <%= link_to "Read more", article_path(article), class: "inline-block mt-4 text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 hover:underline" %>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  </div>

  <% if @articles.empty? %>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-8">No articles found.</p>
  <% end %>
</div>
```

And now the single article template `app/views/articles/show.html.erb`:

```html {filename="app/views/articles/show.html.erb"}
<div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4"><%= @article.title %></h1>

  <div class="prose lg:prose-xl mb-8">
    <%= @article.body %>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Comments</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
    <% @article.comments.each do |comment| %>
      <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <p class="font-semibold"><%= comment.commenter %></p>
        <p class="mt-2"><%= comment.body %></p>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Add a comment:</h2>
  <%= form_with model: [ @article, @article.comments.build ], class: "space-y-4" do |form| %>
    <div>
      <%= form.label :commenter, class: "block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700" %>
      <%= form.text_field :commenter, class: "mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 shadow-sm focus:border-indigo-300 focus:ring focus:ring-indigo-200 focus:ring-opacity-50" %>
    </div>
    <div>
      <%= form.label :body, class: "block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700" %>
      <%= form.text_area :body, rows: 4, class: "mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 shadow-sm focus:border-indigo-300 focus:ring focus:ring-indigo-200 focus:ring-opacity-50" %>
    </div>
    <div>
      <%= form.submit class: "inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 border border-transparent text-sm font-medium rounded-md shadow-sm text-white bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500" %>
    </div>
  <% end %>
</div>
```

### Add the TailwindCSS gem

If you refresh your project, you will notice that the styles are not yet applied. We need to add TailwindCSS to our project:

```shell
bundle add tailwindcss-rails
bin/rails tailwindcss:install
```

The install command will generate the `tailwind.config.js` file. No need to change anything there.

You can now either build once or watch automatically for any change:

```shell
bin/rails tailwindcss:build
# OR
bin/rails tailwindcss:watch
```

Refresh and your styles should now be properly generated and injected into `application.html.erb`:

```ruby {filename="application.html.erb"}
<%# Includes all stylesheet files in app/assets/stylesheets %>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "tailwind", "inter-font", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag :app, "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
```

**Great! Our app is now complete!**

## Part 2: Preparing for Upsun deployment

{{% steps %}}

### Creating Your Upsun Project

```bash
# Create a new project
upsun project:create rails-blog

# Follow the prompts!
[...]
```

Our Upsun git remote is now setup on the repository:

```shell
git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:gmoigneu/upsun-rails-8-tutorial.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:gmoigneu/upsun-rails-8-tutorial.git (push)
upsun	6hd2pooi7mzay@git.ch-1.platform.sh:6hd2pooi7mzay.git (fetch)
upsun	6hd2pooi7mzay@git.ch-1.platform.sh:6hd2pooi7mzay.git (push)
```

### Configuring for Deployment

The magic happens in `.upsun/config.yaml`.
Let's break down each section of a production-ready Rails configuration:

#### 1. Application Definition
```yaml {filename=".upsun/config.yaml"}
applications:
  rails-blog:
    type: "ruby:3.3"
```
This defines your application's runtime environment:
- `rails-blog` is your application name
- `type: "ruby:3.3"` specifies the base image we want to use and the Ruby version

#### 2. Database Relationship
```yaml {filename=".upsun/config.yaml"}
    relationships:
      database: "postgresql:15"
```
This creates a connection between your application and services:
- Links your app to a PostgreSQL 15 database
- Makes the database credentials available via environment variables `DATABASE_`.
- Creates a secure internal network between your app and database

#### 3. Web Server Configuration
```yaml {filename=".upsun/config.yaml"}
    web:
      commands:
        start: "bundle exec puma -b unix://$SOCKET"
      upstream:
        socket_family: unix
      locations:
        "/":
          root: "public"
          passthru: true
          expires: 1h
```
This configures how your application handles web requests:
- `start` command launches Puma using a Unix socket
- `socket_family: unix` optimizes for performance by using Unix sockets instead of TCP
- `locations` configures the web server:
  - `root: "public"` serves static files from the public directory
  - `passthru: true` forwards requests to Rails when no static file is found
  - `expires: 1h` sets cache headers for better performance

#### 4. Build and Deploy Hooks
```yaml {filename=".upsun/config.yaml"}
    hooks:
      build: |
        set -e
        bundle config set frozen false
        bundle install
        bundle exec rails assets:precompile
      deploy: |
        set -e
        bundle exec rails db:migrate
```
These hooks run at specific points in the deployment process:
- `build` runs during the build phase when you are not connected to any other services:
  - Installs Ruby dependencies
  - Compiles assets
- `deploy` runs when deploying the new container on the host:
  - Runs database migrations
  - You could other actions like cache clearing and the likes

#### 5. Persistent Storage
```yaml {filename=".upsun/config.yaml"}
    mounts:
      "/log":
        source: storage
        source_path: log
      "/storage":
        source: storage
        source_path: storage
      "/tmp":
        source: storage
        source_path: tmp
```
Configures persistent storage for your application:
- `/log` for application logs
- `/storage` for uploaded files and Active Storage
- `/tmp` for temporary files
- Each mount persists data across deployments and can be shared between containers

#### 6. Environment Variables
```yaml {filename=".upsun/config.yaml"}
    variables:
      env:
        PIDFILE: "tmp/server.pid"
        RAILS_ENV: "production"
```
Sets environment variables for your application:
- `PIDFILE` specifies where Puma should store its process ID
- `RAILS_ENV` ensures Rails runs in production mode

#### 7. Services Definition
```yaml {filename=".upsun/config.yaml"}
services:
  database:
    type: postgresql:15
```
Defines the services your application needs:
- Creates a PostgreSQL 15 database instance
- Automatically manages backups and updates
- Provides high-availability configuration

#### 8. Routing Configuration
```yaml {filename=".upsun/config.yaml"}
routes:
  "https://{default}/":
    type: upstream
    upstream: "rails-blog:http"
  "https://www.{default}":
    type: redirect
    to: "https://{default}/"
```

Configures how requests reach your application:
- Sets up HTTPS automatically
- Routes requests to your Rails application
- Redirects www to non-www (or vice versa)
- `{default}` is replaced with your environment URL

The last step is to make sure we properly generate the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Upsun automatically detects any `.environment` file at the root of the repository.

```shell
# Set database environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://${DATABASE_USERNAME}:${DATABASE_PASSWORD}@${DATABASE_HOST}:${DATABASE_PORT}/${DATABASE_PATH}"
```

And that's all you need!

{{< callout emoji="ðŸ’¡" type="blue" >}}
You can fetch the [complete configuration on the example repository](https://github.com/gmoigneu/upsun-rails-8-tutorial/blob/main/.upsun/config.yaml).
{{< /callout >}}

### Database Configuration

Update `config/database.yml`:

```yaml {filename="config/database.yml"}
production:
  url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
```

### Asset Serving

Rails 8 uses Propshaft for asset compilation, which works seamlessly with Upsun's static file serving:

```ruby {filename="config/environments/production.rb"}
config.public_file_server.enabled = true
config.public_file_server.headers = {
  'Cache-Control' => 'public, max-age=31536000'
}
```
{{% /steps %}}

## Deploying Your Application

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"

# Deploy to Upsun
upsun push
```

Once the build and deploy processes are complete, your new environment will be ready to serve traffic.

{{< callout >}}
ðŸ’¡ Remember you can always use `upsun ssh` to connect to the container and `upsun sql` to connect to your database.
{{< /callout >}}

If you have setup some seeds in `seeds.rb`, ssh to the container and run:

```shell
upsun ssh
rake db:seed
```

## Monitoring and Scaling

Upsun provides built-in monitoring and scaling capabilities:

```bash
# View application logs
upsun logs

# Scale your application
upsun scale web:2
```

## Conclusion

While Rails 8 makes self-hosting easier, using a Platform-as-a-Service like Upsun lets you focus on what matters most - building great applications. The time saved on infrastructure management, security updates, and scaling concerns easily justifies the platform cost for most teams.

Happy Ruby coding! ðŸš€
