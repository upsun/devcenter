    Experiment articles do not satisfy solely learning-oriented (Tutorial) or even goal-oriented (How-to guides) objectives, while you may take the time to replicate them. Experiment posts are meant instead to explore hyper-specific integrations and use cases to test the limits of frameworks and tools -- or even to highlight shortcomings and headaches author's faced -- perhaps to spark your own experiments.
