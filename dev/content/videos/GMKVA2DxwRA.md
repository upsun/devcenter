The script demonstrates the process of setting up a development environment on Upsun through a terminal session. 
It outlines the steps to clone a staging environment into a new development environment named 'dev1', 
utilizing the 'infrastructure as code' approach specified in a config YAML file. 
The process includes provisioning resources, copying codes, caches, and databases. 
The video shows real-time construction of the environment in the console and examines the build process through logs. 
The presenter manages to set up the environment within approximately two minutes, concluding with a comparison between the newly created development environment 
and the staging environment to ensure they match.
