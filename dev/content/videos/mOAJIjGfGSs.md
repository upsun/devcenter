Product, Engineering, and Design need to work together in a healthy and positive way to ensure smooth, quality feature development. Often the elephant in the room is, who is in charge? We discuss the answer to this question: surprise, it's not one single person or group. Then we look at how to use this answer to your development cycles advantage and how it can open doors to happy and productive teams, and facilitate rapid feature development.

Join Shawna Spoor and Sukhman Virk as they dive into examples of how this worked well during the development of Upsun and when it didn't work so well.
