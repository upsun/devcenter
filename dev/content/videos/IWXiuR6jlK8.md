Embark in an unconventional open source journey with Pol Dellaiera ( [poldellaiera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/poldellaiera/) ) in episode 5 of the chmodcast. 
It all starts with saving every euro to buy his first computer as a kid… 
Then it goes to Drupal, Symfony, and now Nix, where Pol’s contributions as a maintainer 
with commits rights make the lives of PHP developers easier than ever. 
Package manager, operating system and even functional language: Nix does it all. Let’s dive in!
