**Optimizing Collaboration in Development with GitHub Integration**

In this demo, we explore how multiple developers can efficiently use our platform in conjunction with GitHub integration to enhance their workflow. We demonstrate setting up a project, making frontend and backend changes, creating pull requests, provisioning resources, and deploying to staging and production environments. Watch as a front end developer updates UI elements, while a back end developer integrates new data services and updates Node.js. Learn how to manage and review pull requests, handle conflicts, and ensure a seamless and controlled deployment process.
