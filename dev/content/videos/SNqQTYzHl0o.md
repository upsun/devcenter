Blackfire's continuous observability solution empowers developers to monitor their applications' real-time behavior and proactively identify existing bottlenecks or the consequences of upcoming changes before they reach production.

By speeding up the discovery process and allowing long-term performance optimization, Blackfire lets developers stay in control, even during crises, to build and grow their applications confidently.

## Transcript

You've certainly experienced that harsh feeling when your application crashes in production.
Suddenly, you have no idea what went wrong, and messages are pouring in.
Customers and colleagues are demanding answers.

Where do you even begin to figure it out?
Why is your app slowing down under certain circumstances?
Or worse, why did it crash entirely?

This is why we created Blackfire.

As developers, we know how crucial it is to see exactly what's happening inside your application in real time, to spot the areas that need attention, and uncover opportunities for performance improvements.
Think of it as bionic glasses for your web apps.

Blackfire Continuous Observability Solution gives you the power to monitor your apps in real time, helping you catch existing bottlenecks or spot the impact of upcoming changes before they hit production.
It speeds up the discovery process, helping you fine tune performance in the long run.
Blackfire lets you stay in control, even during crisis, to build and scale your applications confidently.

Blackfire smoothly integrates into your existing development and deployment workflows.
Discover improvement opportunities with Blackfire monitoring and continuous profiling.
Use the Deterministic Profiler to pinpoint the exact root causes of bottlenecks, right down to the function or service call level.
Write an automate performance test to assess the impact of changes before they go live.
Set up alerts to be the first one when something goes wrong.

And repeat!

With Blackfire, Symfony.com reduced its load time by 3, and Good Old Games processed 20 times more orders.

Take back control of your app's performance, one step at a time, to stop firefighting once and for all.
