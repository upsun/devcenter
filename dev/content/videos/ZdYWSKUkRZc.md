Put your preview environments on pause to save on resources while Q&A are reviewing. With Upsun we put you back in control of your resource usage and help you reduce your carbon footprint, as well as our own.

A production environment can not be paused but all preview environments (development or staging) can be manually and automatically paused. When an environment is paused, all routes will redirect to a static web page explaining that the environment is paused and a button to resume the environment.
