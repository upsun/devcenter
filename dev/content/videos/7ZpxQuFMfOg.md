01:39 - Why do we care about maximizing optimization efficiency?
• Corey discusses the significance of web applications in today's digital landscape.
• He emphasizes the impact of application performance on user experience, SEO ranking, and resource usage.
• The goal is to deliver fast, efficient, and scalable applications for enhanced user satisfaction and business success.

03:26 - How is your client affected by application optimization?
• Corey explains how poor performance can lead to user frustration and decreased satisfaction.
• He highlights the importance of optimizing applications for user experience, SEO ranking, and resource usage.
• The focus is on meeting user expectations and improving business outcomes through efficient application optimization.

04:43 - What is Browser caching?
• Corey delves into the concept of browser caching as a method to store copies of resources locally.
• He explains how browser caching reduces load times and bandwidth consumption by serving cached resources.
• Implementation strategies, such as leveraging HTTP headers, are discussed to optimize browser caching for improved performance.

08:21 - What is HTTP Caching?
• Corey elaborates on HTTP caching and its use of headers to control caching behavior.
• Common HTTP caching directives, including public, private, no-cache, and no-store, are explained.
• Examples illustrate how each directive is used to manage caching policies and ensure data freshness for improved performance.

10:40 - What are Cache-control directives?
• Corey provides detailed insights into cache-control directives, including max-age, must-revalidate, public, private, no-cache, and no-store.
• Each directive's purpose and potential applications, such as ensuring privacy, data freshness, and real-time updates, are discussed.
• Best practices for setting cache control directives to balance performance and data integrity are highlighted.

19:03 - What is a Content delivery network (CDN)?
• CDNs: globally distributed caches for faster web content delivery.
• Reduce latency, handle traffic spikes, and enhance security.

22:14 - What are image optimizers?
• Automatically optimize images for devices and screen sizes.
• Enhance user experience, reduce bandwidth costs.

24:57 - What is Server-side caching?
• Store pre-rendered pages to reduce server load.
• Enhance page load speed, scalability, and responsiveness.

25:24 - What is Page-caching?
• Cache entire web pages for faster load times.
• Improve user experience and reduce server load.

29:43 - Caching locally at the application and database layer
• Cache frequently accessed data locally using Redis.
• Enhance speed, scalability, and flexibility.

33:17 - Why use an Application Performance Monitoring tool?
• Monitor app performance for better user experience.
• Identify bottlenecks, optimize, and integrate with workflows.

40:32 - How is Redis used?
• Utilize Redis as an in-memory database and cache.
• Enhance speed, scalability, and optimization strategies.

44:23 - Summary
• Understand the layers of your project for optimization opportunities.
• Review HTTP headers to ensure sensible caching settings.
• Consider using a CDN for global content delivery.
• Adopt a data-driven approach to performance optimization.
• Automate performance tests in your workflow for continual improvement.
