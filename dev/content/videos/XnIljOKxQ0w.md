**Enhance Your Deployment Flexibility with Open Source and Nix Images**

Discover how leveraging open-source services and Nix Images ensures flexibility, security, and reproducibility in your deployments. Our platform supports multiple runtimes, such as Python, PHP, Go, Node.js, and integrates with services like RabbitMQ, Kafka, MySQL, Postgres, and Redis. We guarantee deterministic builds, enabling consistent results across different environments, and provide the capability to mix and match runtimes or add any of the 80,000 available Nix packages. See how our multi-runtime setup with Node.js and Python, integrated with the FaceDetect package, showcases the platform's power and versatility. Embrace safe and efficient deployments, tailored to your specific needs.
