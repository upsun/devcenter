From monolith to multi-app join us as we explore more in this Symfony demo: Once upon a time, great people created a great Symfony demo, to be used as a living code example and help us all learn: Bigfoot. Since then, the DevRel team at Platform.sh has forked this repository and created a really fun escape game to showcase Blackfire. And we thought it would be good to have a dedicated frontend for our game, instead of reusing the Bigfoot design.

So we forked it to create an instance for Django. And then we forked it again to make an instance for Drupal. And then another fork, and another. Slowly, we realized that the way forward was to refactor our dear monolith to better fit our needs. Let Florent HUCK show you how we stopped forking around!
