### This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion

Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. 
We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.

These are not hard and fast rules, merely guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a clean
and well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

### Improve the Discussion

Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small.
If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. 
Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. 
Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of 
meeting others who share your interests.

### Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree

You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. 
That’s fine. 
But remember to criticize ideas, not people.
Please avoid:

* Name-calling
* Ad hominem attacks
* Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content
* Knee-jerk contradiction
* Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

### Your Participation Counts

The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. 
Help us influence the future of this community by
choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.
Take a look at our [Contributor License Agreement](/community/about/cla) under which all contributions apply.

Let’s leave our community better than we found it.

### If You See a Problem, Flag It

Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. 
But so are you. 
With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. 
It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and
wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator
intervention.

In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any
reason at any time. 
Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for
any content posted by the community.

### Always Be Civil

Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

* Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
* Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
* Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
* Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize.

These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of these things. If you’re unsure, ask
yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.

This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. 
Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.

### Keep It Tidy

Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:

* Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.
* Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
* Don’t post no-content replies.
* Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
* Don’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.

Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different
direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.

### Post Only Your Own Stuff

You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. 
You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any
other law.
